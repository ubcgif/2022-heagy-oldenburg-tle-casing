abstract = {To advance and optimize secondary and tertiary oil recovery techniques, it is essential to know the areal propagation and distribution of the injected fluids in the subsurface. We investigate the applicability of controlled-source electromagnetic methods to monitor fluid movements in a German oilfield (Bockstedt, onshore Northwest Germany) as injected brines (highly saline formation water) have much lower electrical resistivity than the oil within the reservoir. The main focus of this study is on controlled-source electromagnetic simulations to test the sensitivity of various source–receiver configurations. The background model for the simulations is based on two-dimensional inversion of magnetotelluric data gathered across the oil field and calibrated with resistivity logs. Three-dimensional modelling results suggest that controlled-source electromagnetic methods are sensitive to resistivity changes at reservoir depths, but the effect is difficult to resolve with surface measurements only. Resolution increases significantly if sensors or transmitters can be placed in observation wells closer to the reservoir. In particular, observation of the vertical electric field component in shallow boreholes and/or use of source configurations consisting of combinations of vertical and horizontal dipoles are promising. Preliminary results from a borehole-to-surface controlled-source electromagnetic field survey carried out in spring 2014 are in good agreement with the modelling studies.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, electromagnetic methods have become an accepted tool for a wide range of geophysical exploration purposes and nowadays even for monitoring. Application to hydrocarbon monitoring, for example for enhanced oil recovery, is hampered by steel-cased wells, which typically exist in large numbers in producing oil fields and which distort electromagnetic fields in the subsurface. Steel casings have complex geometries as they are very thin but vertically extended; moreover, the conductivity contrast of steel to natural materials is in the range of six orders of magnitude. It is therefore computationally prohibitively costly to include such structures directly into the modelling grid, even for finite element methods. To tackle the problem we developed a method to describe steel-cased wells as series of substitute dipole sources, which effectively interact with the primary field. The new approach cannot only handle a single steel-cased well, but also an arbitrary number, and their interaction with each other. We illustrate the metal casing effect with synthetic 3-D modelling of land-based controlled source electromagnetic data. Steel casings distort electromagnetic fields even for large borehole-transmitter distances above 2 km. The effect depends not only on the distance between casing and transmitter, but also on the orientation of the transmitter to the borehole. Finally, we demonstrate how the presence of steel-cased wells can be exploited to increase the sensitivity and enhance resolution in the target region. Our results show that it is at least advisable to consider the distribution of steel-cased wells already at the planning phase of a controlled source electromagnetic field campaign.},

abstract = {Controlled-source electromagnetics (CSEM) can be used to image subsurface resistivity and add value in petroleum exploration. However, the application of CSEM methods can be particularly challenging in mature oil and gas fields, where the presence of steel casings and complex seabed infrastructure may influence electromagnetic (EM) fields. The effect of this metal infrastructure can be modeled using the method of moments (MoM), which has previously been demonstrated to be effective in simple situations. We have now developed a methodology for modeling the EM response of complex pipeline geometry using MoM, and we validate our approach numerically and experimentally; the difference between finite-element and MoM modeling is less than 3%, whereas the difference between experimental data and MoM results is less than 30%. We further develop a fast and efficient approach to model the EM response of horizontal pipeline infrastructure. First, we create individual pipe sections of custom shape; when assembled, these sections are used to construct the entire pipeline system. We then identify "precise"and "approximate"zones based on how accurately we need to perform the calculations. We find that the electric field values in the approximate zone can be calculated accurately and quickly using previously saved table values, and therefore achieve a considerable reduction in computational requirements. Finally, we apply our methodology to a real situation of a 60 km horizontal seabed pipeline and find that the electric field distortion can be calculated rapidly and efficiently with our custom-built algorithm.},

abstract = {I have developed an approximate inversion scheme for surface-borehole electromagnetic data. The method aims at reducing the computational burden arising by the fine discretization required to accurately solve for the field distribution in the full complexity of the borehole system together with the reservoir medium. I first analyze numerical simulations of the surface-borehole response performed for a 1D layered earth, also incorporating the realistic complexity of the borehole system. The analysis brings useful insight to the requirement of incorporating fluid and mud/cement electrical properties when implementing an inversion by numerically simulating the full complexity of the system. Subsequently, the synthetic data set was used to test an inversion method that uses the data dominated by the casing effect to approximately describe the casing secondary fields. A scaling factor is then introduced to account for the current induced in the well as the exciting source is placed further below the casing shoe. The method is found to fairly well recover the known 1D resistivity strata; still, some bias is expected for the resistivity close below the casing shoe, where the data are anticipated to be the most distorted by the casing effect.},

abstract = {We conducted a detailed experimental investigation of the effect of CO2 injection on the electrical conductivity of water bearing porous media, needed for an improved geophysical monitoring of CO2 storage reservoirs. Therefore, we developed an experimental set-up that allows to investigate electrical characteristics of the injection process as well as the impact of dissolved CO2 on pore water conductivity. We found that a gaseous, fluid and supercritical pure CO2 phase bears no relevant conductivity at pressures up to 13 MPa and temperatures up to 50° C. When CO2 dissolves in pore water, pressure-dependent dissociation processes can double the pore water conductivity, that can be used in leakage detection. This is quantified by an adaptation of Archie's law. The empirical adaptation and the experimental data are confirmed by combined geochemical-geoelectrical modelling. Furthermore, water-saturated sand samples were investigated while CO2 displaced the pore water at pressures up to 13 MPa and temperatures up to 40° C. A decrease in electrical conductivity by a factor of up to 33 was measured, corresponding to a residual water saturation of 14-19%. Qualitatively, a decrease was also demonstrated under supercritical conditions. As an integrative interpretation, a conceptual model of electrical rock properties during CO2 sequestration is presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.},

abstract = {The electrical rock conductivity is a sensitive indicator for carbon dioxide (CO2) injection and migration processes. For a reliable balancing of the free CO2 in pore space with petrophysical models such as Archie's law or for the detection of migrating CO2, detailed knowledge of the pore water conductivity during interaction with CO2 is essential but not available yet. Contrary to common assumptions, pore water conductivity cannot be assumed constant since CO2 is a reactive gas that dissolves into the pore water in large amounts and provides additional charge carriers due to the dissociation of carbonic acid. We consequently carried out systematic laboratory experiments to quantify and analyse the changes in saline pore water conductivity caused by CO2 at thermodynamic equilibrium. Electrical conductivity is measured on pore water samples for pressures up to 30 MPa and temperatures up to 80°C. The parameter range covers the gaseous, liquid and supercritical state of the CO2 involved. Pore water salinities from 0.006 up to 57.27 g L-1 sodium chloride were investigated as well as selective other ion species. At the same time, the CO2 concentration in the salt solution was determined by a wet-chemical procedure. A two-regime behaviour appears: for small salinities, we observe an increase of up to more than factor 3 in the electrical pore water conductivity, which strongly depends on the solution salinity (low-salinity regime). This is an expected behaviour, since the additional ions originating from the dissociation of carbonic acid positively contribute to the solution conductivity. However, when increasing salinities are considered this effect is completely diminished. For highly saline solutions, the increased mutual impeding causes the mobility of all ions to decrease, which may result in a significant reduction of conductivity by up to 15 per cent despite the added CO2 (high-salinity regime). We present the data set covering the pressure, temperature, salinity and ion species dependence of the CO2 effect. Furthermore, the observations are analysed and predicted with a semi-analytical formulation for the electrical pore water conductivity taking into account the species' interactions. For the applicability of our results in practice of exploration and monitoring, we additionally provide a purely empirical formulation to compute the impact of CO2 on pore water conductivity at equilibrium which only requires the input of pressure, temperature and salinity information.},

abstract = {Well integrity is one of the major concerns in long-term geologic storage sites due to its potential risk for well leakage and groundwater contamination. Evaluating changes in electrical responses due to energized steel-cased wells has the potential to quantify and predict possible wellbore failures, as any kind of breakage or corrosion along highly-conductive well casings will have an impact on the distribution of subsurface electrical potential. However, realistic wellbore-geoelectrical models that can fully capture fine scale details of well completion design and the state of well damage at the field scale require extensive computational e.ort, or can even be intractable to simulate. To overcome this computational burden while still keeping the model realistic, we use the hierarchical finite element method which represents electrical conductivity at each dimensional component (1-D edges, 2-D planes and 3-D cells) of a tetrahedra mesh. This allows well completion designs with real-life geometric scales and well systems with realistic, detailed, progressive corrosion and damage in our models. Here, we present a comparison of possible discretization approaches of a multi-casing completion design in the finite-element model. The e.ects of the surface casing length and the coupling between concentric well casings, as well as the e.ects of the degree and the location of well damage on the electrical responses are also examined. Finally, we analyze real surface electric field data to detect wellbore integrity failure associated with damage.},

The field inside the casing may be found by first finding the field in the formation and then using this field as an incident field for the pipe alone. This result permits the formation response to be recovered from the measured field in the borehole by applying a correction for the known properties of the casing.

abstract = {As motivation for considering new electromagnetic techniques for hydraulic fracture monitoring, we develop a simple financial model for the net present value offered by geophysical characterization to reduce the error in stimulated reservoir volume calculations. This model shows that even a 5% improvement in stimulated reservoir volume for a 1 billion barrel (bbl.) field results in over 1 billion U.S. dollars (US$) in net present value over 24 years for US$100/bbl. oil and US$0.5 billion for US$50/bbl. oil. The application of conductivity upscaling, often used in electromagnetic modeling to reduce mesh size and thus simulation runtimes, is shown to be inaccurate for the high electrical contrasts needed to represent steel-cased wells in the earth. Fine-scale finite-difference modeling with 12.22-mm cells to capture the steel casing and fractures shows that the steel casing provides a direct current pathway to a created fracture that significantly enhances the response compared with neglecting the steel casing. We consider conductively enhanced proppant, such as coke-breeze-coated sand, and a highly saline brine solution to produce electrically conductive fractures. For a relatively small frac job at a depth of 3 km, involving 5,000 bbl. of slurry and a source midpoint to receiver separation of 50 m, the models show that the conductively enhanced proppant produces a 15% increase in the electric field strength (in-line with the transmitter) in a 10-$\Omega$m background. In a 100-$\Omega$m background, the response due to the proppant increases to 213%. Replacing the conductive proppant by brine with a concentration of 100,000-ppm NaCl, the field strength is increased by 23% in the 100-$\Omega$m background and by 2.3% in the 10-$\Omega$m background. All but the 100,000-ppm NaCl brine in a 10-$\Omega$m background produce calculated fracture-induced electric field increases that are significantly above 2%, a value that has been demonstrated to be observable in field measurements.},

abstract = {The acquisition of airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data co-located with water well data provides an essential dataset for constructing an accurate rock physics relationship between resistivity from AEM and lithology from wells. Results from an AEM survey in Butte and Glenn Counties, California, U. S. A., where 41 water wells are located within 100 m of the AEM flight lines, provide a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of water wells on AEM data. Based on both systematic numerical analyses and examination of the field data, we find that the only noise source related to the wells that affects the AEM signals in our study area is the powerlines; the effect of the steel-casings in the study area is negligible. Our numerical simulations yield two important findings: (1) the effect of the powerline is mainly dependent upon the resistivity of the ground pathway between the base of the powerline poles, and (2) for the resistivity structure in the study area, when the ground contact resistance is sufficiently low, the effect of the powerline will be seen in the AEM data until there is a separation distance of 174 m from the powerline; the total powerline percentage effect less than 3% was considered to negligible. However, we find, in the field data, an average separation distance between the powerline and high-quality AEM data (i.e. no impact from the powerlines) is only 60% of this this predicted distance. We attribute this to high ground contact resistance caused by degradation of the grounded electrodes located at the bottom of the powerline poles. For our 41 wells, after removing any soundings contaminated by powerline noise, we are left with high-quality soundings located 0 m to 160 m from the water wells, with an average distance of 77 m.},

abstract = {The work in this paper is motivated by the increasing use of electrical and electromagnetic methods in geoscience problems where steel-cased wells are present. Applications of interest include monitoring carbon capture and storage and hydraulic fracturing operations. Also of interest is detecting flaws or breaks in degrading steel-casings-such wells pose serious environmental hazards. The general principles of electrical methods with steel-cased wells are understood and several authors have demonstrated that the presence of steel-cased wells can be beneficial for detecting signal due to targets at depth. However, the success of a direct current (DC) resistivity survey lies in the details. Secondary signals might only be a few per cent of the primary signal. In designing a survey, the geometry of the source and receivers, and whether the source is at the top of the casing, inside of it, or beneath the casing will impact measured responses. Also the physical properties and geometry of the background geology, target and casing will have a large impact on the measured data. Because of the small values of the diagnostic signals, it is important to understand the detailed physics of the problem and also to be able to carry out accurate simulations. This latter task is computationally challenging because of the extreme geometry of the wells, which extend kilometers in depth but have millimeter variations in the radial direction, and the extreme variation in the electrical conductivity which is typically 5-7 orders of magnitude larger than that of the background geology. In this paper, we adopt a cylindrical discretization for numerical simulations to investigate three important aspects of DC resistivity in settings with steel-cased wells. (1) We examine the feasibility of using a surface-based DC resistivity survey for diagnosing impairments along a well in a casing integrity experiment. This parameter study demonstrates the impact of the background conductivity, the conductivity of the casing, the depth of the flaw, and the proportion of the casing circumference that is compromised on amplitude of the secondary electric fields measured at the surface. (2) Next, we consider elements of survey design for exciting a conductive or resistive target at depth. We show that conductive targets generate stronger secondary responses than resistive targets, and that having an electrical connection between the target and well can significantly increase the measured secondary responses. (3) Finally, we examine common strategies for approximating the fine-scale structure of a steel cased well with a coarse-scale representation to reduce computational load. We show that for DC resistivity experiments, the product of the conductivity and the cross-sectional area of the casing is the important quantity for controlling the distribution of currents and charges along its length. To promote insight into the physics, we present results by plotting the currents, charges, and electric fields in each of the scenarios examined. All of the examples shown in this paper are built on open-source software and are available as Jupyter notebooks.},

abstract = {The applicability of crosswell electromagnetic (EM) tomography is limited when the boreholes are steel cased. Steel casing is typically eight orders of magni- tude more conductive than the formations around the borehole. Consequently, the high frequency signals which are needed to resolve the formation conductiv- ity distribution in the interwell region cannot be radi- ated or received by antennas inside the casing. Intro- duction of small insulating gaps in the casing eliminates these problems by creating ports where signals can exit and enter the casing, making the casing an electric bipole antenna. The gapped casing can be operated in a shorted-port or open-port mode. In the shorted-port mode, the voltage is specified at a source port, and the current is measured at all the remaining shorted ports. In the open-port mode, the current is specified at a source port, and the voltage is measured at all the remaining open ports. For high-frequency shorted-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the skin depth in the formations surrounding the casing. For high- frequency open-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the casing gap interval, provided that it is less than the formation skin depth. The open-port mode is preferred. The interval between casing gaps is determined mainly by the well spacing. If the effective bipole length is proportional to the well spacing, the cross- well signal-to-noise ratio is approximately independent of the well spacing and the interwell resolution is approximately proportional to the well spacing at constant source input power. For large well spacings, gapped casing antennas outperform open-hole tools. Steel-cased wells completed or retrofitted with insu- lating gaps offer a stable, low-cost, permanent set of electrodes to implement long-term monitoring of pe- troleum reservoir fluid movements. Gapped casings offer a practical way to achieve high-frequency, wide- aperture EM tomographic datasets at large well spac- ings. Gapped casings can also be used for deep EM probing of the formations around a single well},

abstract = {Electromagnetic methods that utilize controlled sources have been applied for natural resource exploration for more than a century. Nevertheless, concomitant with the recent adoption of marine controlled-source electromagnetics (CSEM) by the hydrocarbon industry, the overall usefulness of CSEM methods on land has been questioned within the industry. Truly, there are few published examples of land CSEM surveys carried out completely analogously to the current marine CSEM standard approach of towing a bipole source across an array of stationary receivers, continuously transmitting a low-frequency signal and interpreting the data in the frequency domain. Rather, different sensitivity properties of different exploration targets in diverse geological settings, gradual advances in theoretical understanding, acquisition and computer technology, and different schools in different parts of the world have resulted in a sometimes confusing multitude of land-based controlled-source EM surveying approaches. Here, I aim to review previous and present-day approaches, and provide reasoning for their diversity. I focus on surface-based techniques while excluding airborne EM and well logging and on applications for hydrocarbon exploration. Attempts at the very demanding task of using onshore controlled-source EM for reservoir monitoring are shown, and the possible future potential of EM monitoring is discussed.},

Induced‐polarization effects can be simulated in these models by including a complex, frequency‐dependent surface impedance on the outer surface of the cylinder.

abstract = {The presence of steel-cased wells and other infrastructure causes a significant change in the electromagnetic fields that has to be taken into consideration in modeling and interpretation of field data. A realistic and accurate simulation requires the borehole casing to be incorporated into the modeling scheme, which is numerically challenging. Due to the huge conductivity contrast between the casing and surrounding media, a spatial discretization that provides accurate results at different spatial scales ranging from millimeters to hundreds of meters is required. In this paper, we present a full 3D frequency-domain electromagnetic modeling based on a parallel finite-difference algorithm considering the casing effect and investigate its applicability on the borehole-to-surface configuration of the Hontom{{\'{i}}}n CO2 storage site. To guarantee a robust solution of linear systems with highly ill-conditioned matrices caused by huge conductivity contrasts and multiple spatial scales in the model, we employ direct sparse solvers. Different scenarios are simulated in order to study the influence of the source position, conductivity model, and the effect of the steel casing on the measured data. Several approximations of the real hollow casing that allow for a large reduction in the number of elements in the resulting meshes are studied. A good agreement between the modeled responses and the real field data demonstrates the feasibility of simulating casing effects in complex geological areas. The steel casing of the well greatly increases the amplitude of the surface electromagnetic fields and thus improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the sensitivity to deep targets.},

@article{Rucker2010,
abstract = {An electrical-resistivity survey was completed at the T tank farm at the Hanford nuclear site in Washington State, U.S.A. The purpose of the survey was to define the lateral extent of waste plumes in the vadose zone in and around the tank farm. The T tank farm consists of single-shell tanks that historically have leaked and many liquid-waste-disposal facilities that provide a good target for resistivity mapping. Given that the site is highly industrialized with near-surface metallic infrastructure that potentially could mask any interpretable waste plume, it was necessary to use the many wells around the site as long electrodes. To accommodate the long electrodes and to simulate the effects of a linear conductor, the resistivity inversion code was modified to assign low-resistivity values to the well's location. The forward model within the resistivity code was benchmarked for accuracy against an analytic solution, and the inverse model was tested for its ability to recreate images of a hypothetical target. The results of the tank-farm field survey showed large, low-resistivity targets beneath the disposal areas that coincided with the conceptual hydrogeologic models developed regarding the releases. Additionally, in areas of minimal infrastructure, the long-electrode method matched the lateral footprint of a 3D surface-resistivity survey with reasonable fidelity. Based on these results, the long-electrode resistivity method may provide a new strategy for environmental characterization at highly industrialized sites, provided a sufficient number and density of wells exist. {{\textcopyright}} 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {Gas hydrates are a potential energy resource, a possible factor in climate change and an exploration geohazard. The University of Toronto has deployed a permanent seafloor time-domain controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) system offshore Vancouver Island, within the framework of the NEPTUNE Canada underwater cabled obser-vatory. Hydrates are known to be present in the area and due to their electrically resistive nature can be monitored by 5 permanent electric field receivers. However, two cased boreholes may be drilled near the CSEM site in the near future. To un-derstand any potential distortions of the electric fields due to the metal, we model the marine electromagnetic response of a conductive steel borehole casing. First, we consider the commonly used canonical model consisting of a 100m, 100 m thick resistive hydrocarbon layer embedded at a depth of 1000 m in a 1m conductive host medium, with the addition of a typical steel production casing extending from the seafloor to the resistive zone. Results show that in both the frequency and time domains the distortion produced by the casing occurs at smaller transmitter-receiver offsets than the offsets required to detect the resistive layer. Second, we consider the experimentally determined model of the offshore Vancouver Island hydrate zone, consisting of a 5.5m, 36m thick hydrate layer overlying a 0.7m sedimentary half-space, with the addition of two borehole casings extending 300 m into the seafloor. In this case, results show that the distortion produced by casings located within a 100 m safety zone of the CSEM system will be measured at 4 of the 5 receivers. We conclude that the boreholes must be positioned at least 200 m away from the CSEM array so as to minimize the effects of the casings.},

Modeling shows that the electromagnetic fields at reservoir depths can be 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than those on the seabed, thus opening up the possibility to see deeper or detect and monitor smaller targets. In the case of measurements inside metal casing, the use of reciprocity to interchange the source and receiver allows the casing conductor to be considered as an antenna. This antenna is excited by a source inside the casing, which induces a current flowing along the casing conductor. Based on the current distribution, a casing dipole moment and an equivalent length were derived for the transverse magnetic (TM) mode.

Outside the casing, the electric field, at large distances from the borehole, has a radial direction that provides a sufficient depth of investigation in this direction. The measurement requires knowledge of the casing conductance. Application of transmission line theory is based on the fact that the electric field in the formation is radial within the intermediate zone, re- sulting in the conclusion that the vertical resolution of such a measurement would depend only upon the spacing of the electrodes required to estimate the second derivative of the potential.},

abstract = {Electrical logging in cased holes is a subject of strong current interest. In this paper we develop the conventional theory of physical responses of electrical logging through casing where the formation resistivity changes vertically and where the conductance of the casing varies. The theory is developed for a four-electrode sonde with one current electrode, and three receiver electrodes that measure current leakage into the formation. All the theoretical developments in the paper are derived using approximate transmission-line theory. An expression for the array coefficient is first derived and then used to obtain an expression for the apparent conductivity of the formation. Then a relation is established between the array coefficient, geometrical factor and conductance of the casing. This step led to a method of measuring casing conductance. Knowing casing conductance, the response of the array to vertical changes in formation conductivity is measurable. It was established, that when the array length is less than the thickness of the formation layer, the measured apparent conductivity is equivalent to the true conductivity of the formation, unlike the case of normal and induction logs. It was also established that measurement of apparent conductivity can be made accurately inside a casing of finite length when it essentially exceeds the length of the electrode array. The results contained in this paper show that electrical logging through casing is possible in wells with conventional casing strings that penetrate layered sedimentary formations.},

This effect includes the attenuation and phase shift of a signal diffusing through the casing wall. Sample casings are studied under low field strength in the linear regime where the casing's electrical properties are independent of the applied signals. Frequency spectra are measured for transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polariza- tions from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Numerical models, devel- oped to simulate the casing response, match the ex- perimental data very well. Finally, studies of the effects of the earth's magnetic field and casing rema- nent magnetization show that these steady biases do not affect the ac signal detection.},

@article{Heagy2019a,
abstract = {Simulating direct current resistivity, frequency domain electromagnetics and time domain electromagnetics in settings where steel cased boreholes are present is of interest across a range of applications including well-logging, monitoring subsurface injections such as hydraulic fracturing or carbon capture and storage. In some surveys, well-casings have been used as `extended electrodes' for near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased well is in a modeling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging. Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modeling electromagnetic problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization. The associated software implementation includes modeling capabilities for direct current resistivity, time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes, and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated. We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and fluxes through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on direct current resistivity and electromagnetics in steel-cased wells. The software implementation is open source and included as a part of the SimPEG software ecosystem for simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics.},

@article{Wilt2020,
abstract = {Wellbore integrity is of paramount importance to subsurface resource extraction, energy storage, and hazardous waste disposal. We have developed a simple noninvasive technology for casing integrity screening, based on the continuity of electrical current flow. Applying low-frequency current to a wellhead, with a distant return electrode, produces a casing current dependent on the background formation and the properties and depth extent of the well casing. These currents in turn generate surface electrical fields that can be captured in a radial profile and can be used to analyze properties of the well casing. Numerical modeling results reveal a strong relation of the electric field to the casing properties and depth extent of the well. A small breakage in the casing produces a profile coincident to a cased well with a completion depth above the break. A corroded patch, in which the casing conductivity is reduced, also alters the field profiles, and its depth may be estimated by comparing to the profile expected from the well completion diagrams. The electric field profiles are also strongly dependent on background resistivity distributions and on whether the well was drilled using water-or oil-based drilling fluids. We validate the proof of concept in a field experiment, in which we apply currents at the wellheads of two adjacent wells with different casing lengths in an area of known background resistivity. The two profiles are similar in appearance but are offset in amplitude by more than a factor of five, consistent with the theoretical analysis and the 3D modeling results. These results demonstrate that our approach has promise for mapping the general casing condition without well intervention. This approach can be a practical and effective tool for rapidly screening several wells before expensive logging-based technologies are used for casing inspection in detail.},

@article{Heagy2017,
abstract = {Simulations and inversions of geophysical electromagnetic data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, definition of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SimPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second example demonstrates how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},
