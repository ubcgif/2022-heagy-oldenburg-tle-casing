\caption{
    Example to illustrate the impact of wells on the ability to detect targets at depth. The image on the left shows the model of a target in a half-space with a steel-cased well. The image in the center shows current density if no casing were present and the image on the right shows the currents with the conductive casing present. The arrows indicate the direction of current flow and the color is the amplitude of the current density.
