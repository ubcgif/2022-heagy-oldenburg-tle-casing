    DC resistivity experiment where a point source is positioned inside of a long steel-cased well $5\times10^6$ S/m in a $100$ $\Omega$m wholespace. (a) Conductivity model with positive electrode location (red plus); (b) current density; (c) charge density, note that the colorbar has been saturated; (d) electric fields.
